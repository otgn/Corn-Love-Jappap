<h2>JAPPAPTV Minecraft Contents</h2>
I love Jappap TV. Jappap is world famous streamer and YouTuber. 
<br>Her contents are legends all the time.
<br>In Korean language, I would say "자빱은 전설이다.. 이게 마크냐.. <str>마크도 인생이다"</str></body>
<br>If you want to watch her videos, you can click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwT_iMjmRsnAitwgpaR1Tqw">here</a>
<p>
    In Korea, Minecraft was known as one only popluar for kids.
    <br><strong>But</strong> in 2020, JappapTV changed this recognition with her legendary Minecraft contents, "U-Jeong-Li".
